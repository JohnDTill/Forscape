//Steps:
//Declare make[]
//Call on line 5 instantiates {make[](ℝ, ℝ)}
//During instantiation, declare echo[ℝ, ℝ]
//Return type is {echo[ℝ, ℝ]}
//Call on line instantiates {echo[ℝ, ℝ](ℝ)}
//Call on line 7 instantiates {make[](𝕊, 𝕊)}
//During instantiation, declare echo[𝕊, 𝕊]
//Return type is {echo[𝕊, 𝕊]}
//Call on line instantiates {echo[𝕊, 𝕊](𝕊)}
