### Focus on the problem, not the implementation details

**Forscape** solves engineering problems with an unprecedented level of abstraction so you get reliable results quickly. This high-level approach starts with intuitive syntax. Program with the same notation you use to write equations thanks to our innovative math rendering with semantic formatting. Matrices, fractions, symbolsâ€“ write code using the same notation you use to think through problems on the whiteboard.
