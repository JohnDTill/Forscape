### Focus on the problem, not the implementation details

**Forscape** solves engineering problems with an unprecedented level of abstraction so you get reliable results quickly. This high-level approach starts with intuitive syntax. Program with the same notation you use to write equations thanks to our innovative math rendering with semantic formatting. Matrices, fractions, symbolsâ€“ write code using the same notation you use to think through problems on the whiteboard.

## Prerequisites

* Qt (https://www.qt.io/download)

## Bundled software

* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) (Header-only linear algebra)
* [readerwriterqueue](https://github.com/cameron314/readerwriterqueue) (Lock-free queue for single-producer/single-consumer messages)

## License

This project aims to be financially maintainable while ultimately resulting in an entirely open source codebase. The core is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details. Additional modules will be sold commercially for a six-year period starting at release, after which they will be added to the open source core.

## Contributing

Feel free to report any bugs in the issue tracker and message me about feature requests or general design discussion. Pure C++ tests are run automatically and required to pass before merging to main, but please run Qt tests if GUI code is modified (eventually this will be automated too).
