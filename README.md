# Forscape
## A language and editor for scientific computation

### Focus on the problem, not the implementation details

**Forscape** solves engineering problems with an unprecedented level of abstraction so you get reliable results quickly. This high-level approach starts with intuitive syntax. Program with the same notation you use to write equations thanks to our innovative math rendering with semantic formatting. Matrices, fractions, symbolsâ€“ write code using the same notation you use to think through problems on the whiteboard.

## Installation

*But first, a warning*. Forscape is in early alpha. Feedback and bug reports are welcome, but backward compatibility will be broken. The language syntax will be broken. The file encoding will be broken. Crashes are likely.

#### Windows

Download and run [ForscapeInstaller_Win64.exe](https://github.com/JohnDTill/Forscape/releases/download/pre-alpha-0.0.2/ForscapeInstaller_Win64.exe).
Alternately, install the development prerequisites listed below and compile from source.

#### Linux
Use the [.deb file](https://github.com/JohnDTill/Forscape/releases/download/pre-alpha-0.0.2/forscape_0.0.1_amd64.deb) or compile from source using:
```
apt-get install cmake python3 qt5-default libqt5svg5-dev
git clone https://github.com/JohnDTill/Forscape
cd ./Forscape/example/exampleWidgetQt
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
./Forscape #Run
```

## Development Prerequisites

* Qt5/6 (https://www.qt.io/download)
  * QtSvg module
* Python3 on the system path

#### Optional
* [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/) on system path for debugging AST

#### Bundled software

* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) (Header-only linear algebra)
* [parallel-hashmap](https://github.com/greg7mdp/parallel-hashmap) (Header-only, very fast and memory-friendly hashmaps and btrees)
* [readerwriterqueue](https://github.com/cameron314/readerwriterqueue) (Lock-free queue for single-producer/single-consumer messages)
* [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) (Very fast, header-only/compiled, C++ logging library.)
* Fonts with extensive unicode support:
  * [Computer Modern](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/computer-modern)
  * [JuliaMono](https://github.com/cormullion/juliamono)
  * [Quivira](http://quivira-font.com/)
